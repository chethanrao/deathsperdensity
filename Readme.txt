Deaths per density measure makes more sense than deaths per population because a population can be spread about over a larger
area and still the deaths could be more. Though when considering deaths per density it would be better if one considers
a particular city rather a large country as density would different in a city and a village within a country.
Social distancing would be a higher for a city with lower density by default as compared to city with higher density.
Smaller the area of measurement shows better how the city or county or a small region was managed.
