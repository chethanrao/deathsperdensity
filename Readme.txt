Social distancing would be a higher for a place with lower density by default as compared to place with higher density.
Corona Virus confirmed cases per density measure makes more sense than Corona Virus confirmed cases  per population because a population can be spread about over a larger
area and still the the confirmed cases could be more. Though when considering deaths per density it would be better if one considers
a particular city rather a large country as density would different in a city and a village within a country.
Smaller the area of measurement shows better how the city or county or a small region was managed.
